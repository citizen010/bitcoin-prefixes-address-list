A __Bitcoin address__, or simply __address__, is an identifier of 27-34 alphanumeric characters, beginning with the number 1, 3 or bc1, that represents a possible destination for a bitcoin payment. Addresses can be generated at no cost by any user of Bitcoin. It is also possible to get a Bitcoin address using an account at an exchange or online wallet service. Also you can generate it offline and store on paper or at any digital storage.

There are currently three address formats in use in Bitcoin mainnet:

1. P2PKH (Pay 2 Public Key Hash) which begin with the number 1
2. P2SH (Pay 2 Script Hash) type starting with the number 3.
3. [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) type starting with bc1.
